# Recently when updating nextcloud version's I noticed some apps weren't making it through to the other side. #

In particular the nextcloud social app was missing after an update. When I tried to reinstall it from my clouds appstore it was giving me a failed to extract error.

 So this is more of a workaround that I've been using in the meantime to manually install and activate it.

## The steps ##

 You will need ssh access to your cloud server and root.
