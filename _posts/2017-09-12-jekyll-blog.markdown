Github.io and jekyll can make lovely static site development possible.

# If you can get it running!

Originally tried installing on my raspberry pi4 server and running remotely but was having too many issue's.
Installation was pretty smooth on my ubuntu pc setup tho, so ymmv.
	It was an adventure exploring the code and tweaking it to my tastes~!
